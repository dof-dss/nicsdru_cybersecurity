Base Drupal install for Origins sites.

When installing site run 
```shell script

```

### Structure Sync
After running drush config-import, also run
```shell script

```
This imports the block content, menu links and taxonomy terms into the site.


If you want to export any blocks, menus or taxonomy terms you have used run
```shell script
lando drush ea
```

### Backup and Migrate
A site backup has been included in the folder 'backups'. This can be imported into your site to allow you to view the 
site progress.

To restore this backup after installing the site and importing the config, navigate to Manage > Configuration > 
Development > Backup and Migrate.

Click on the Restore tab, upload the .tar.gz under 'Upload a Backup File'. Choose Restore To Entire Site in the dropdown 
options and then click Restore now.
